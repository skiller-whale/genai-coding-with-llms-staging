# Skiller Whale, Exercises for Generative AI: Coding with LLMs/Agents

This repo includes exercises to accompany Skiller Whale sessions on Generative AI: Coding With LLMs/Agents.

During each session you'll be asked to write and edit code in some of the files.

## Running Exercises

Whilst you can download these exercises locally for reference, they are intended to be run using the hosted environment provided by Skiller Whale during sessions.

This makes managing API credentials much easier, and means you don't need to install or set up anything locally.
